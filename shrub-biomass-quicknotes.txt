shrub biomass quicknotes

for each species
	-different equation for leaves and stems (sometimes but not always)
	-spreadsheet notes which types of equation and which parameters to use
		- e = exponential -> y = ae^(bx)
		- l = linear -> y = ax + b
		- p = power -> y = ax^(b)
		- m = mean -> y = dunno
	- variables same for all
		- y = biomass (g)
		- x = basal diam (mm)

my next steps
	X- create version of spreadsheet that contains these columns:
		X- SpeciesCode
		X- For both leaves and stems (with unique column names):
			X- Function (tells equation type)
			X- a
			X- b
			X- Source (of function)
		X- **ADD CHRVIS TO THIS SPREADSHEET (GENERAL E EQN)
	- write R code that relates shrub species to biomass equation
		X***trimws() [ARTTRI has one, not sure which others]
		X- make 0s NAs
		X- calculate average basal diameter per quadrat per species
			X- multiply by #stems in quadrat => total mm in quadrat PER SPECIES
		X- average quadrats to get mm/m in plot
		X- join df with eqn df by species
		- write function for each... function
		- for each row,
			- $g.Lvs <- whichever function.Leaves($basalmm, $a.Leaves, $b.Leaves)



decisions/misc stuff i did
	- CHRVIS - no equation in spreadsheet. Used general equation because 
	  rabbitbrush is similar to sagebrush, and sagebrush uses general eqn
	- VACCAE - no leaf equation in spreadsheet. Used VACSCO leaf equation 
	  (from NSERP) because it looks more similar to VACSCO than VACMEM
